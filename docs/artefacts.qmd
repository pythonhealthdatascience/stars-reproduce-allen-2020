This page evaluates the extent to which Monks et al. 2016 meets the recommendations for the sharing of code and associated materials.

First, it copies information from the best practice audit by @monks_computer_2023. The items in this audit were based on <mark>ADD CITATIONS</mark>.

Secondly, it assesses whether the article meets recommendations from the recently published STARS framework by @monks_towards_2024.

## Best practice audit (Monks and Harper 2023)

| Item | Description | Met by study? |
| - | -- | - |
| Digital Object Identifier | Does the model have a DOI and promise of persistence? Can it be cited?
| Open Researcher and Contributor ID | Is the model linked to one or more of the authors via an ORCID?
| Licence | Does the repository have a recognised open license to control the use of code, liabilty and credit?
| Readme file | Is there an obvious file that provides an overview of the repository/model and it purpose?
| Link to published paper | Do models shared externally from journal articles contain a link to the published article?
| Steps to run code | Does the readme file or similar describe the steps required to execute the simulation model?
| Formal dependency management | Has a formal tool, e.g. renv, conda, or poetry been used to manage software dependencies for the simulation model? |
| Informal dependency management | Has an informal list or description of software, or OS dependencies been provided?
| Code Testing | Is there any evidence of tests that have been applied to the code to check that it functions correctly?
| Local execution | Can the simulation model and associated files be downloaded and in theory executed on a local machine
| Remote execution | Can the simulation model be executed online using free or commercial infrastructure?
