## Figure 2

The bold line shows the median results of 30 trials, and the fainter lines show the minimum and maximum from the 30 trials."](../original_study/article_fig2.png){width=80%}

## Figure 3

The figure also shows the number of patients not allocated to a dialysis session at any time. The bold line shows the median results of 30 trials, and the fainter lines show the minimum and maximum from the 30 trials."](../original_study/article_fig3.png)

## Figure 4

These results do not include those receiving inpatient care. The patient population progresses through infection over three months (with 80% infected).

## Section from results about being unallocated to a session

**From results section:** "In the planned strategy of using half of one of the largest units (Queen Alexandra) for COVID-positive dialysis outpatients, and then using a second unit (Basingstoke, also provid- ing up to half of its capacity for COVID-positive dialysis outpatient patients) for any excess, the dialysis system copes without any patients being unable to be allocated to a session (or without any need in dropping dialysis frequency). Workload in units that do not take COVID- positive outpatients will fall during the outbreak (though some work will flow back to them if they need to care for COVID-negative patients displaced from the units caring for COVID- positive patients)."

**Why this is in scope:** The figures do not provide any information on the count of unallocated patients. The change in dialysis frequency is assumed to be an implicit consequence of whether or not there are any unallocated patients necessitating they wait a day or change frequency in the model.

**Exactly what we are aiming to reproduce from this statement:** Observation of no patients being unable to be allocated to a session.
