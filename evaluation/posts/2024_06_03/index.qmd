## Work log

### 10.30-11.03 Modifying code to provide more control over replication seeds

Made changes to `sim_replicate.py`:

* Changed `multiple_replications()` to accept a base number, so the random number set is the replication number plus the base number
* Changed `run_replications()` to accept base number to function, and input this to call of `multiple_replications()`

Started changing `end_trial_analysis.py` to enable the function to accept changes to the filename, but then decided a simpler solution (that doesn't require changing their code in multiple places) is just to use `os.rename()` within our notebook. Set up notebook to run through 15 different base seeds. Paused timing whilst this ran...

### 11.29-

Resumed timing after finished running the 15 different base seeds.

Compared each by eye against the original figures in the paper.

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 345

# Times from today
times = [
    ('10.30', '10.31')]

# Print time used and remaining
calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```

## Suggested changes for protocol/template
