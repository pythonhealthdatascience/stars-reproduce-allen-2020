## Work log

### 10.30-11.03 Modifying code to provide more control over replication seeds

Made changes to `sim_replicate.py`:

* Changed `multiple_replications()` to accept a base number, so the random number set is the replication number plus the base number
* Changed `run_replications()` to accept base number to function, and input this to call of `multiple_replications()`

Started changing `end_trial_analysis.py` to enable the function to accept changes to the filename, but then decided a simpler solution (that doesn't require changing their code in multiple places) is just to use `os.rename()` within our notebook. Set up notebook to run through 15 different base seeds. Paused timing whilst this ran...

### 11.29-11.36 Fixed issue in duplication between my replications

Looked over images, but all looked very similar to one another. Realised this was because my method for modifying the seeds still had lots of matching seeds between each run - for example:

* Base 0: Random number sets are 0-30
* Base 1: Random number sets are 1-31
* Base 2: Random number sets are 2-32

Hence, changed this in `reproduction.ipynb` so the base numbers were 0, 100, 200, 300 etc, and so:

* Base 0: Random number set 0-30
* Base 100: Random number set 100-130
* Base 200: Random number set 200-230

Then paused timing as reran again...

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 345

# Times from today
times = [
    ('10.30', '10.31')]

# Print time used and remaining
calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
