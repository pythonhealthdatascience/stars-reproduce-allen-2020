### Research compendium

Continued working on research compendium...

* After various attempts, managed to set up pytest which runs the model then checks dataframes are equal....
    * Required modifying `sim_replicate.py` so that can choose not to plot the results, else pytest gets libGL errors and opens new windows with figures that you have to close before test continues
    * `pytest` only works if run from `reproduction/` folder
