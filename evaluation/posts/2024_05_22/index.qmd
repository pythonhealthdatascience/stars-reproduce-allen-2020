Created repository, uploaded materials, chose license.

## Made repository (3.1.2)

Without using template (does not yet exist, will create based on this repository, which is a test-run)

## 12.11 - 12.16 Upload materials (3.1.3)

Article:

* <https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0237628>

Supplementary materials:

* <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237628.s001>
* <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237628.s002>

Code - both code sources should be the same and pretty much same data, hence used Zenodo as that is the archived version:

* <https://zenodo.org/records/3760626>
* <https://git.exeter.ac.uk/tmwm201/dialysis-service-delivery-covid19> 

<mark>Protocol: Suggest what to record in logbook i.e. record the links. And that you record start time, do it, record end time, note down in logbook - unless that is too prescreptive.</mark>

## 12.18-12.19 Choose license (3.1.4)

No need to change from MIT, as that was used by Allen et al. 2020.

<mark>Protocol: Say that default in template is MIT but may need to change. Makes sense to have this as a combined step with above perhaps? Although helpful to see seperate.</mark>

<mark>Template: Set as STARS Project Team in default MIT license - is that correct?</armk>

## Display on website

Set up article and supplementary to display on website in `study_publciation.qmd`.

<mark>Protocol: Need to add creation of pages to display it within Quarto to logbook - when to do it, and when to time it. I naturally found I wanted to do it after upload. Publication in study_publication. Code in study_code. Although that does mean looking at the code before scoping? So actually, makes sense to do code later, when write up.</mark>

## 13.20-13.46 Reading article (3.2.1)

Read article, making notes in `study_summary.qmd`

<mark>easier to consolidate reading into a summary if it has a structure to it</mark>

<mark>are the description of the sample part of scope? could do with some recommendation on this.</mark>

<mark>need seperate page for scope</mark>

<mark>whilst reading, find myself highlighting things for scope</mark>

<mark>for something like RCR, would it count as reproduction if we only focussed on part of the paper? worth perhaps noting that - although doesn't change what we do now</mark>

<mark>Protocol: This can be changed later. For now, when want to add images, added them into quarto_site alongside study_summary. If decide in scope, later move to reproduction/</mark>

<mark>i made notes here as i read paper as I find that helps me concentrate better when reading, but that doesn't have to be prescriptive?</mark>

## 13.47- Consolidating notes on article (3.2.1)

Make rough notes whilst reading article, tidied these into a structured summary of model, to consolidate my understanding of model.

Didn't yet have a pre-defined structure for this. Figued simplest option is to use STRESS DES structure?
