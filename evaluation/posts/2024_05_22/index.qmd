### Untimed: Inform the authors

Not relevant for this, as it is a test-run using a paper Tom was involved with and is one of the corresponding authors on.

### Untimed: Made repository

As this is a test-run, was not made using a template (as it does not yet exist, but will be created based on this repository).

### 12.11 - 12.16: Upload materials

Links to source of uploaded materials...

Article:

* <https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0237628>

Supplementary materials:

* <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237628.s001>
* <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237628.s002>

Code - both code sources should be the same and pretty much same data, hence used Zenodo as that is the archived version:

* <https://zenodo.org/records/3760626>
* <https://git.exeter.ac.uk/tmwm201/dialysis-service-delivery-covid19> 

### 12.18-12.19: Choose license

No need to change from MIT, as that was used by Allen et al. 2020.

### Untimed: Display article on website

Set up article and supplementary to display on website in `study_publication.qmd`.

### 13.20-13.56: Reading article

Read article, making notes in `study_summary.qmd` (initially rough notes, then tidied slightly).

## Notes from read through of paper

**Type of model:** Discrete event simulation (excluding sections of the paper relevant to another model - a Monte-Carlo vehicle routing model of patient transport)

**Purpose of model:** Model service delivery in dialysis network during change in COVID-19 cases.

**How model was created:**

* Python 3.8
* SimPy 3
* MatPlotLib
* STRESS reporting guidelines
* DES on Intel i9-7980XE CPU with 64GB RAM running Ubuntu 19.10 Linux

**Context:**

* Wessex - mixed urban/rural setting, renal dialysis services cares for 644 patients, nine centres. 75% of patients use patient transport services.
* COVID-positive patients treated seperately to COVID-negative.

**Model design:**

* Model change in inpatient and outpatient workload during pandemic at each dialysis unit in network. Estimate over three to six months. Estimate number of patients required to travel to different unit and change in travel time.
* Inputs: Patient location postcode. Travel time routine. Worst case time spread COVID Fergeson. Mortality rate, time patient COVID-positive before admission, and inpatient rate of stay were local parameters.
* Defined period (e.g. one year). Patients progress through phases of COVID (negative, positive, some with inpatient care, recovred, died). In each COVID state, model seeks to put them in appropriate unit and session, opening COVID-positive sessions in units that allow it. COVID-positive don't mis with others.
* Run 30 times, show median and extremes.

![Patient pathway figure from Allen et al. 2020](../../../original_study/article_fig1.png){width=50%}

* All patients receive dialysis 3 times a week. Each patient starts on either Monday or Tuesday.
* Have proportion of patients either fixed or sampled from stochastic distribution for phases of COVID state and care.
* COVID seperate from uninfected and recovered.

![Baseline model parameters from Allen et al. 2020](../../../original_study/article_tab1.png){width=50%}

For allocation to units, use search strategy:

* COVID negative or recovered - look for place in current unit, if no space, find closest unit (by travel time) with available space
* COVID positive - put in Queen Alexandara, and if full, make capacity in Basingstoke. If new COVID session required, more all COVID negative patients in that session as per neg rules.
* COVID positive inpatient - all in Queen Alexandra (but allows search for unit with inpatients)
* Unallocated - if can't allocate to any units, attempt again next day

Once every week, attempts to reallocate patients back to starting unit or closest available. This is so cared more nearby and to compress COVID positive patients into few units and sessions.

COVID positive converted back to COVID negative when no longer needed.

**Results:**

* States current median travel time from home to dialysis unit, and current capacity.
* Figures 2, 3, 4 show impact of COVID infecting 80% patients in next three months. 
    * Figure 2 - number of patients in each COVID state over 150 days
    * Figure 3 - as figure 2, but divided by unit? and with diffferent categories shown.
    * Figure 4 - patients displced from current unit, and travel time added
* Using half of Queen Alexandra and then Basingstoke for excess for COVID positive copes without any patients being unallocated to session and no need to reduce dialysis frequency.
* Reduces workflow in units not taking COVID positive patients.
* Displaced patients typically need 20 extra minutes to get to temporary care place (sometimes 50 minutes)

![Figure 3](../../../original_study/article_fig3.png){width=50%}

![Figure 4](../../../original_study/article_fig4.png){width=50%}

**Discusion:**

* Dialysis unit can cope with worst case spread. Requires reallocation of patients, will impact on ambulance and efficiency.
* Likely significant patient partessures, current capacity breached, consider moving dislaysi requipment during peak COVID positive.
* Transporting individually unsustainable.(Markov?)
* Model limitations - assumes can reallocate immediatley, assumes current capacity maintained (i.e. no staff shortage), not modelled timing, not included home dialysis.

### 13.56-14.27: Identifying scope

Made page for scope under evaluation - `scope.qmd`. Then went through process of:

1. Uploading tables and figures
2. Added each table and figure, and marking as being within scope or not
3. Looking through paper for key results, focussing on abstract and results section.
4. Compared those against the tables and figures to check if they are captured or not.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" collapse=true}

## Notes from identification of key results and comparison with figures

Abstract:

* **Need secondary site, reduces workload in other sites, increases in primary site:** "Outpatient COVID-19 cases will spillover to a secondary site while other sites will experience a reduction in workload. The primary site chosen to manage infected patients will experience a significant increase in outpatients and inpatients."
    * Captured in Figure 3
* **Up to 140 COVID positive with 40-90 inpatients, breaching capacity:** "At the peak of infection, it is predicted there will be up to 140 COVID-19 positive patients with 40 to 90 of these as inpatients, likely breaching current inpatient capacity."
    * Captured in Figure 2 (combine yellow and red lines) and Figure 3 (having inpatients across two sites and not just one)

Results:

* **No patients unallocated:** "In the planned strategy of using half of one of the largest units (Queen Alexandra) for COVID-positive dialysis outpatients, and then using a second unit (Basingstoke, also provid- ing up to half of its capacity for COVID-positive dialysis outpatient patients) for any excess, the dialysis system copes without any patients being unable to be allocated to a session (or without any need in dropping dialysis frequency). Workload in units that do not take COVID- positive outpatients will fall during the outbreak (though some work will flow back to them if they need to care for COVID-negative patients displaced from the units caring for COVID- positive patients)."
    * Initially thought this was out of scope, but following chat with Tom, noticed that Figure 2 shows no unallocated (purple line)
* **Displaced patients have 20 minutes (sometimes up to 50) extra travel time** "Outpatients may be displaced from their usual unit of care either because they need to travel to a COVID-positive session in another hospital, or because their unit has had to free up sessions for COVID-positive sessions. These patients typically require 20 minutes extra travel time to get to their temporary place of care (assuming they are travelling alone), with some requiring 50 minutes extra travel in each direction to/from dialysis."

### Untimed: Reorganising scope page

Reorganised into collapsible boxes for clearer layout.

### Untimed: Consensus decision on scope

Discussed scope with Tom Monks.

* Corrected "Markov" is "Monte Carlo".
* Whilst discussing, noticed that the number of unallocated patients is in Figure 2, so removed from scope.
* Otherwise agreed with scope.

### Untimed: Uploading to Zenodo

Not doing for this one as it is a test-run.

## Timings

```{python}
from datetime import datetime

# List of time tuples with prescribed format
FMT = '%H.%M'
times = [
    ('12.11', '12.16'),
    ('12.18', '12.19'),
    ('13.20', '13.56'),
    ('13.56', '14.27')]

total_min = 0
for t in times:
    # Convert to datetime object
    h0 = datetime.strptime(t[0], FMT)
    h1 = datetime.strptime(t[1], FMT)
    # Find difference in minutes and add to total
    total_min += (h1 - h0).total_seconds() / 60

# Time in hours and minutes
print(f'Time spent today: {int(total_min)//60}h {int(total_min)%60}m')

# Find time remaining
max = 40*60
remain_min = max - total_min
print(f'Time remaining: {int(remain_min//60)}h {int(remain_min%60)}m')

# Find proportion out of 40 hours
print(f'Used {round(total_min/max*100,1)}% of 40 hours max')
```

## Suggested changes for protocol/template

✅ = Made the change.

Protocol:

* ✅ Suggest keeping a record of the links where uploaded materials were sourced from within the logbook (as below)
* ✅ Template will contain MIT but default, so modify this section to explain that it is about checking whether need to change from MIT.
* ✅ Suggest that create pages to display the journal article, supplementary and code at a point after having gone through the code familiarisation steps.
* Reflect on how want to deal with summary page. I used it to help me read through and summarise the article. However, later down the line, the STRESS-DES and ISPOR reporting guidelines could potentially provide a more complete summary (depending on how do the "evidence" sections - i.e. copying in text, or just referring to a part in the paper). So do we need a summary page? Or are these just notes that I make in the logbook? As don't necessarily want to prescribe that everyone has to write a summary? Leaning towards that.
* Make reference to particular pages in template (e.g. when define scope, the file path to the scope template)
* For defining scope, add a suggestion that the description of the sample is unlikely to be part of scope, and that focus is on the discrete event simulation and the results of that model, and use that to guide you when deciding what is in scope.
* For scope, change from suggesting what to include, to it being a step by step of first look at tables and figures, then look at rest of text for key results, then evaluate whether those key results are covered by the tables and figures.
* Add to stage when upload journal articles, that at the same time, they also download the images and tables from the article (not supplementary) as individual files and upload them to the repository too.
* For scope, simplify protocol to just look for key results in abstract and results sections. Don't think should really need to look in discussion or conclusion, as those are more interpretation focussed, and should otherwise be highlighted in abstract - but don't make it prescriptive, just a recommendation, as focus here is just on finding key results, and recommending where they are likely to be in most (but not necessarily all) papers

Template:

* In license, have set "Copyright (c) 2024 STARS Project Team" - is this correct? Also, should it mention the original authors or not? Presuming not, as they will already have license file within that folder, and we will add yet another license file to the reproduction folder so it is stand alone.
* Should we have MIT license for reproduction/ and then CC-BY license for main repository?
    * In which case, would need to specify in repository that changing license in reproduction/ folder and not main folder. And explain somewhere what the license files apply to.

Other:

* We might sometimes only reproduce part of a study - for example, a paper with multiple models and we focus on the discrete-event simulation. Think about the impact this has, and whether we need to note this somewhere? For example, whether the badges would actually be awarded for this work (or whether that matters - or if important bit is about ability to reproduce the simulation)? Depending on planned output for this work (e.g. if did want to explore publishing with [Rescience C](https://rescience.github.io/), what this would mean). Doesn't change what we do during replication - just perhaps comments around it re: badges, and what we do with it.
