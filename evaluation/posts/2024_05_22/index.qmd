Created repository, uploaded materials, chose license.

## Made repository (3.1.2)

Without using template (does not yet exist, will create based on this repository, which is a test-run)

## 12.11 - 12.16 Upload materials (3.1.3)

Article:

* <https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0237628>

Supplementary materials:

* <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237628.s001>
* <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237628.s002>

Code - both code sources should be the same and pretty much same data, hence used Zenodo as that is the archived version:

* <https://zenodo.org/records/3760626>
* <https://git.exeter.ac.uk/tmwm201/dialysis-service-delivery-covid19> 

<mark>Protocol: Suggest what to record in logbook i.e. record the links. And that you record start time, do it, record end time, note down in logbook - unless that is too prescreptive.</mark>

<mark>Protocol: Need to add creation of pages to display it within Quarto to logbook - when to do it, and when to time it</mark>

## 12.18-12.19 Choose license (3.1.4)

No need to change from MIT, as that was used by Allen et al. 2020.

<mark>Protocol: Say that default in template is MIT but may need to change</mark>

<mark>Template: Set as STARS Project Team in default MIT license - is that correct?</armk>

## 12.25-
