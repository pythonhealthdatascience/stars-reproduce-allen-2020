title: "Reproduction success"
---

Of the three items in the scope, 100% (3 out of 3) were considered to be **successfully reproduced**.

In each case, it was felt that there were **minimal variation** between the original figures and reproduction, and that any variation was likely due to randomness of the simulation (as the original simulation was not controlled using seeds).
